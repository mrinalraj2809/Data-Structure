# 12-SwapDoublyLinkedList-C
Write a C program to perform the following operations using doubly linked list with header node. Header node should maintain the count of number of nodes in he list after each operation:
	a) to insert a node next to a node whose information field is specified.
	b) to delete first node if pointer to the last node is given.
	c) to delete a node at the specifies=d position in the list (1<=pos<=n where ‘n’ 		is the total number of nodes in the list & ‘pos’ is the position where data 		is to be deleted).
	d) to display the content of the list.
	e) to swap n th and m th nodes information in the list.
